Group 5: Ecosystem Simulator
Objective: Simulate a simple ecosystem with plants and animals interacting in a text-based environment.

Instructions:

Define Classes:
Animal class: Properties for Name, Type (e.g., Predator or Prey), and Population.
Plant class: Properties for Name and GrowthRate.
Main Menu: Create options for:
View the ecosystem's status (e.g., "Lions: 5, Deer: 20, Grass: 50").
Simulate a day in the ecosystem (e.g., predators eat prey, plants grow).
Introduce new species or remove existing ones.
Simulation Loop: Update populations each day based on interactions:
Predators decrease prey populations.
Prey decrease plant populations.
Plants grow over time.
Display Results: Show the status of the ecosystem after each simulated day.
Bonus: Add random events like droughts (reducing plant growth) or population booms.
